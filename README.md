# GithubPage + Sphinx setup tutorial

This repository is designed to be the end point of a tutorial on how to setup a project in github with documentation generated in sphinx and hosted on github pages. 

The tutorial will start with the 4 files located in the `DownloadMe` folder, and we will build everything from there. Student will follow along in a newly created repository. 

This page contains the step-by-step content of the tutorial. I will be typing everything on the shared screen, but you may want to follow along with this file to copy-paste some longer commands if you miss a bit. (Although I do encourage you to also 'type along')
